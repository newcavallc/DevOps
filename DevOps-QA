1.) EC2 Instance Running Out of Disk Space:
-------------------------------------------
    Check /root - os:
           - Investigate and clear space in /root.
    Check the logs:
           - Examine and free up space in /var/log and /tmp.
    Check /application - for our application:
           - Inquire about the application's purpose and log location.
           - Explore clearing space in the application directory.
           - If necessary, take an EBS Snapshot and increase the associated volume size.


2.) Prometheus obtains metrics in two ways:
-------------------------------------------
    Pull Approach: Exposes metric endpoints (e.g., Java App/Node.js) for Prometheus to scrape data.

    Push Approach: The App sends metrics via a gateway back to Prometheus for storage.

    Q: Why choose PUSH?
    A: For apps that may not run continuously, PUSH ensures timely metric updates.

Prometheus is a toolkit for monitoring and alerting, ensuring system and application reliability. 
It collects metrics to inform decision-making, supporting dashboards and alerting. It monitors Docker 
containers, capturing CPU usage, memory, network traffic, and more, with built-in support for exporters 
like Node Exporter and Docker.


3.)What is Kubernetes kOpt (Kubernetes Operations)?
---------------------------------------------------
Kubernetes kOps is not limited to testing; it is a versatile tool used for production deployment and 
management of Kubernetes clusters.


4.) What is an instance fleet in AWS?
-------------------------------------
An AWS instance fleet is a diverse set of EC2 instances designed for specific use cases:
    * pricing models
    * Amazon EMR
    * Application that require tailoring.


5.) Are you supporting any applications? If yes what application sever?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
No, I haven't worked with application servers for:

Java: (Tomcat, JBoss, Weblogic)
NodeJS: (IIS)
Python: (Django)


6.) How to check logs on a Docker container - the last 200 lines?
-----------------------------------------------------------------
To check logs and filter only the last 200 lines, use the following command:
# docker container logs <container_name> --tail 200

This command will display the last 200 lines of the container logs.


7.)  What will happen to container logs if you restart the container? Will it be lost?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Restarting a container won't result in log loss; data is only lost upon container deletion 
due to their statelessness.

Consider using external persistent storage like SPLUNK for app logs. SPLUNK is effective for 
log aggregation, analysis, and visualization, supporting Docker container log storage.


8.) What is vertical scaling and horizontal scaling? Explain w/ a use caseâ€¦
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vertical scaling: 
    - increases CPU/RAM capacity, exemplified by moving an EC2 instance from 
      Large to 2x.Large for enhanced features. 

Horizontal scaling:
    - manages incoming traffic, demonstrated by an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) handling 
      increased load while maintaining the same app features.
