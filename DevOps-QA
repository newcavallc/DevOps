1.) EC2 Instance Running Out of Disk Space:
-------------------------------------------
    Check /root - os:
           - Investigate and clear space in /root.
    Check the logs:
           - Examine and free up space in /var/log and /tmp.
    Check /application - for our application:
           - Inquire about the application's purpose and log location.
           - Explore clearing space in the application directory.
           - If necessary, take an EBS Snapshot and increase the associated volume size.


2.) Prometheus obtains metrics in two ways:
-------------------------------------------
    Pull Approach: Exposes metric endpoints (e.g., Java App/Node.js) for Prometheus to scrape data.

    Push Approach: The App sends metrics via a gateway back to Prometheus for storage.

    Q: Why choose PUSH?
    A: For apps that may not run continuously, PUSH ensures timely metric updates.

Prometheus is a toolkit for monitoring and alerting, ensuring system and application reliability. 
It collects metrics to inform decision-making, supporting dashboards and alerting. It monitors Docker 
containers, capturing CPU usage, memory, network traffic, and more, with built-in support for exporters 
like Node Exporter and Docker.


3.)What is Kubernetes kOpt (Kubernetes Operations)?
---------------------------------------------------
Kubernetes kOps is not limited to testing; it is a versatile tool used for production deployment and 
management of Kubernetes clusters.


4.) What is an instance fleet in AWS?
