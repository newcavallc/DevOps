2.) Prometheus obtains metrics in two ways:

    Pull Approach: Exposes metric endpoints (e.g., Java App/Node.js) for Prometheus to scrape data.

    Push Approach: The App sends metrics via a gateway back to Prometheus for storage.

    Q: Why choose PUSH?
    A: For apps that may not run continuously, PUSH ensures timely metric updates.
