TERRAFORM STATE BASICS
# terraform apply
- After infractructure is provisioned...
- The Terraform State File is created in your local working dir: “terraform.tfstate”.
            * It’s the underlying database and is critical to your entire TF infrastructure.
            * It’s a map that contains all the infrastructure info.

DESIRED STATE:
- Is nothing but your TF Configuration files: versions.tf, ec2-instance.tf, etc.

CURRENT STATE:
- Real world Resource created by TF…  like EC2 instances

WHAT IS TERRAFORM LOCK?
SHORT: 
It’s to prevent all other operations from writing state. 

LONG:
If supported by your backend, Terraform will lock your state for all operations that could write state. 
This prevents others from acquiring the lock and potentially corrupting your state. State locking happens automatically 
on all operations that could write state. You won't see any message that it is happening.

lock.hcl
was introduced in Terraform 0.14. It's designed to record the exact package versions used to satisfy each provider requirement in your configuration. 
This ensures that every member of your team and your deployment systems use the same provider versions, avoiding inconsistencies and potential bugs.
